## Description

This app was completed in 2 week period as the final project of the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) software development bootcamp. The website uses the [KÃ¶ppen climate classification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification) to serve the user with locations that are similar to their input destination.

The app uses a non-relational database to store information about the climate zones and their corresponding latitude/longitude values, and also cities and their lat/lng values. External APIs are used to grab relevant pictures, current weather, and historical weather.
