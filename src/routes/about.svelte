		<h1>What is whereto?</h1>
		<p>
			WhereTo. is an experimental web app, created to compare different travel destinations by
			climate.
		</p>
		<p>
			The user can search for similar destinations around the world, which are categorised using
			their <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification"
				target="_blank">KÃ¶ppen climate classification</a
			>.
		</p>

		<h1>Who made it?</h1>
		<p>
			The project was developed by a 'Team X' - a group of 5 students on the <a
				href="https://northcoders.com/"
				target="_blank">Northcoders</a
			> Coding Bootcamp. This was their first time working as a group.
		</p>
		<p>Development took place over a couple of weeks in February-March 2022.</p>You can find out more in the project's <a
		href="https://github.com/Dance1211/climate-app"
		target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.
		<p></p>

		<h1>How's it built?</h1>
		<p>
			The team decided to try out some new technology that was not taught on the course (which was
			mainly based around JavaScript, Node and React).
		</p>
		<p>
			The app uses the <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank">Svelte</a> framework,
			<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>,
			<a href="https://www.mongodb.com" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> for the databases, and various APIs
			to grab location images and weather data. All brought together with copious amounts of JavaScript,
			HTML and CSS.
		</p>
