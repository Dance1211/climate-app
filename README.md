## About the App

This web app was completed over a 2 week period in early 2022, as a final group project on the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) software development bootcamp. The website uses the [KÃ¶ppen climate classification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification) to serve the user with locations that have a similar climate to their input destination.

The app uses a non-relational database to store information about the climate zones and destinations, along with their corresponding latitude/longitude values. External APIs are used to grab relevant pictures, the current weather, and historical weather patterns.

### Technology Used

For this project we decided to use several pieces of tech that were new to the team, embracing technology rated highly by developers at the time - in addition to the fundamentals that we had been learning and refining throughout bootcamp.

- Front End: [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Back End: [SvelteKit framework](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- APIs: [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview), [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), [Okiolab Weather Data API](https://oikolab.com/api-details#api=weather&operation=weather-data)
- Languages: Svelte, TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript, HTML


## Live Demo

An initial prototype of the app can be found at: [LINK](add link here).

The core search functionality is in place, meaning that the user can retrieve a list of search results, and explore potential destinations.

Please note - the 'My Places' and 'My Searches' pages currently feature hard-coded links for demo purposes. We would like to make this feature entirely dynamic at a later date.

Due to limits on external API requests, there may be occasional issues retrieving results from third party APIs. In which case, you can take a look at our [video preview](#video-preview) for a quick overview. Alternatively (if feeling adventurous), you can [run the app locally](#run-the-app-locally).

## Run the App Locally

Follow these steps to run a local version of the project. Please be aware that there is quite a bit of initial set up involved.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v. 17.0.0 or higher (JavaScript runtime environment)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (JavaScript package manager)

### Clone & Install Dependencies

- First, download the project into a local folder. In your terminal, run:

  `git clone https://github.com/Dance1211/climate-app.git`

- Then navigate into the new folder, and install dependencies:

  `cd climate-app`
  
  `npm install`

### Set up the Database & API Keys

You will need an external database and a number of third-party API keys to run the project as intended. Each of these web services requires an active user account, so you may need to sign up. The app only uses features in the 'free tier' of each service.

1. Create a [MongoDB Atlas database](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) project by following parts 1-4 of [these instructions](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). This will store data about climate zones, places, and coordinates. 

2. Retrieve your MongoDB URI:
    - Go to your Atlas database using the MongoDB website. Press `Connect -> Connect your application` (using Node.js driver).
    - Copy the URI (connection string)
    - Edit the URI so that `<password>` is replaced by your real MongoDB password
    - Edit the URI so that `myFirstDatabase` is replaced by `locations`

3. Register for a [Google Maps API Key](https://mapsplatform.google.com/maps-products/), to get photos of our different destinations.
    These APIs need to be enabled in your settings:
    - Geocoding API
    - Places API

4. Register for an [Oikolab Weather Data API key](https://oikolab.com/api-details#api=weather&operation=weather-data), to get historical weather data.

5. Register for an [OpenWeather API key](https://openweathermap.org/api), to get the current weather.

### Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project. 

Insert the following code - replacing the placeholder values with your newly-generated API keys and database details:

```js
VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_URI
MONGODB_DB_LOCATIONS=locations
MONGODB_KGCODES=kg-codes
MONGODB_CITIES=cities

VITE_OIKO_WEATHER_KEY=YOUR_OIKOLAB_API_KEY

VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY 
```
### Seed the Database
Finally, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/seed](http://localhost:3000/seed) and press the `Seed the Database Now` button. This should load the project data in to your MongoDB database. 

It may take a while to load this page - and then to populate your database. You can see the progress in your node console. 

### Running the App

Once the above steps are complete, the app can by run locally and viewed in your web browser with:

`npm run dev -- --open`

## Further Development

Whilst we are proud of what we achieved on this project in the short time frame, we have a bunch of 'desirable' refinements to both functionality and styling that were not quite possible within 6-7 days of actual coding time. Plus a series of additional features that we would ideally like to include.

You can see some of these desirable features in our wireframes below - created early on in the project to help guide the final product.
