## Description

This app was completed over a 2 week period in early 2022, as a final group project on the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) software development bootcamp. The website uses the [KÃ¶ppen climate classification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification) to serve the user with locations that have a similar climate to their input destination.

The app uses a non-relational database to store information about the climate zones and destinations, along with their corresponding latitude/longitude values. External APIs are used to grab relevant pictures, the current weather, and historical weather patterns.

### Technology Used

For this project we decided to use several pieces of tech that were new to the team, embracing technology that is currently highly rated by developers - in addition to the fundamentals that we had been using throughout bootcamp.

- Front End: [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Back End: [SvelteKit framework](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- APIs: [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview), [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), [Okiolab Weather Data API](https://oikolab.com/api-details#api=weather&operation=weather-data)
- Languages: Svelte, TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript, HTML


## Demo

An initial working prototype of the app can be found at: [LINK](add link here).

The core search functionality is in place, and the user can retrieve a list of search results. 

Please note - the 'My Places' and 'My Locations' pages currently feature hard-coded links, for demo purposes. We would like to make this feature entirely dynamic at a later date.

Due to limits on external API requests, there may be occasional issues retrieving results from third party APIs. In which case, you can take a look at our [video preview](#video-preview) for a general overview. 

## Further improvements

Whilst we are proud of what we achieved as a team in the short time frame, we have a bunch of 'desirable' refinements to both the functionality and styling that were not quite possible within the 2 weeks. Plus a series of additional features that we would like to add. 

You can see some of these desirable features in our wireframes below - created early on in the project.
